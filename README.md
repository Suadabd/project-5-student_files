# project-5-employee-directory
 OBJECTIVE:
 This is project 5 of the TreeHouse Techgree Course. In this projected I created a employee directory for a fictional company called 'Awesome Startup'. I sourced information on 12 random employees from a User Generated API (https://randomuser.me/). When a user clicks on an employee a modal appears with information such as name, email, location etc.
